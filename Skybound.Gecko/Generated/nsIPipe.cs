    /// nsIPipe represents an in-process buffer that can be read using nsIInputStream
    /// and written using nsIOutputStream.  The reader and writer of a pipe do not
    /// have to be on the same thread.  As a result, the pipe is an ideal mechanism
    /// to bridge data exchange between two threads.  For example, a worker thread
    /// might write data to a pipe from which the main thread will read.
    ///
    /// Each end of the pipe can be either blocking or non-blocking.  Recall that a
    /// non-blocking stream will return NS_BASE_STREAM_WOULD_BLOCK if it cannot be
    /// read or written to without blocking the calling thread.  For example, if you
    /// try to read from an empty pipe that has not yet been closed, then if that
    /// pipe's input end is non-blocking, then the read call will fail immediately
    /// with NS_BASE_STREAM_WOULD_BLOCK as the error condition.  However, if that
    /// pipe's input end is blocking, then the read call will not return until the
    /// pipe has data or until the pipe is closed.  This example presumes that the
    /// pipe is being filled asynchronously on some background thread.
    ///
    /// The pipe supports nsIAsyncInputStream and nsIAsyncOutputStream, which give
    /// the user of a non-blocking pipe the ability to wait for the pipe to become
    /// ready again.  For example, in the case of an empty non-blocking pipe, the
    /// user can call AsyncWait on the input end of the pipe to be notified when
    /// the pipe has data to read (or when the pipe becomes closed).
    ///
    /// NS_NewPipe2 and NS_NewPipe provide convenient pipe constructors.  In most
    /// cases nsIPipe is not actually used.  It is usually enough to just get
    /// references to the pipe's input and output end.  In which case, the pipe is
    /// automatically closed when the respective pipe ends are released.
