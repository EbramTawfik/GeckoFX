    /// that would be focused if the window was active.
    ///
    /// If the window's reference is to a frame element (iframe, browser,
    /// editor), then the child window contains the element that is currently
    /// focused. If the window's reference is to a root element, then the root is
    /// focused. If a window's reference is null, then no element is focused, yet
    /// the window is still focused.
    ///
    /// The blur event is fired on an element when it loses the application focus.
    /// After this blur event, if the focus is moving away from a document, two
    /// additional blur events are fired on the old document and window containing
    /// the focus respectively.
    ///
    /// When a new document is focused, two focus events are fired on the new
    /// document and window respectively. Then the focus event is fired on an
    /// element when it gains the application focus.
    ///
    /// A special case is that the root element may be focused, yet does not
