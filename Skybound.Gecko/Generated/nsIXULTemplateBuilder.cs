	/// <summary>
    /// A template builder, given an input source of data, a template, and a
    /// reference point, generates a list of results from the input, and copies
    /// part of the template for each result. Templates may generate content
    /// recursively, using the same template, but with the previous iteration's
    /// results as the reference point. As an example, for an XML datasource the
    /// initial reference point would be a specific node in the DOM tree and a
    /// template might generate a list of all child nodes. For the next iteration,
    /// those children would be used to generate output for their child nodes and
    /// so forth.
    ///
    /// A template builder is attached to a single DOM node; this node is called
    /// the root node and is expected to contain a XUL template element as a direct
    /// child. Different template builders may be specialized in the manner in
    /// which they generate and display the resulting content from the template.
    ///
    /// The structure of a template is as follows:
    ///
    /// <rootnode datasources="" ref="">
    /// <template>
    /// <queryset>
    /// <query>
    /// </query>
    /// <rule>
    /// <conditions>...</conditions>
    /// <bindings>...</bindings>
    /// <action>...</action>
    /// </rule>
    /// </queryset>
    /// </template>
    /// </rootnode>
    ///
    /// The datasources attribute on the root node is used to identify the source
    /// of data to be used. The ref attribute is used to specify the reference
    /// point for the query. Currently, the datasource will either be an
    /// nsIRDFDataSource or a DOM node. In the future, other datasource types may
    /// be used.
    ///
    /// The <queryset> element contains a single query and one or more <rule>
    /// elements. There may be more than one <queryset> if multiple queries are
    /// desired, and this element is optional if only one query is needed -- in
    /// that case the <query> and <rule>s are allowed to be children of the
    /// <template> node
    ///
    /// The contents of the query are processed by a separate component called a
    /// query processor. This query processor is expected to use this query to
    /// generate results when asked by the template builder. The template builder
    /// then generates output for each result based on the <rule> elements.
    ///
    /// This allows the query processor to be specific to a particular kind of
    /// input data or query syntax, while the template builder remains independent
    /// of the kind of data being used. Due to this, the query processor will be
    /// supplied with the datasource and query which the template builder handles
    /// in an opaque way, while the query processor handles these more
    /// specifically.
    ///
    /// Results implement the nsIXULTemplateResult interface and may be identified
    /// by an id which must be unique within a given set of query results.
    ///
    /// Each query may be accompanied by one or more <rule> elements. These rules
    /// are evaluated by the template builder for each result produced by the
    /// query. A rule consists of conditions that cause a rule to be either
    /// accepted or rejected. The condition syntax allows for common conditional
    /// handling; additional filtering may be applied by adding a custom filter
    /// to a rule with the builder's addRuleFilter method.
    ///
    /// If a result passes a rule's conditions, this is considered a match, and the
    /// content within the rule's <action> body is inserted as a sibling of the
    /// <template>, assuming the template builder creates real DOM content. Only
    /// one rule will match a result. For a tree builder, for example, the content
    /// within the action body is used to create the tree rows instead. A matching
    /// result must have its ruleMatched method called. When a result no longer
    /// matches, the result's hasBeenRemoved method must be called.
    ///
    /// Optionally, the rule may have a <bindings> section which may be used to
    /// define additional variables to be used within an action body. Each of these
    /// declared bindings must be supplied to the query processor via its
    /// addBinding method. The bindings are evaluated after a rule has matched.
    ///
    /// Templates may generate content recursively, using the previous iteration's
    /// results as reference point to invoke the same queries. Since the reference
    /// point is different, different output will typically be generated.
    ///
    /// The reference point nsIXULTemplateResult object for the first iteration is
    /// determined by calling the query processor's translateRef method using the
    /// value of the root node's ref attribute. This object may be retrieved later
    /// via the builder's rootResult property.
    ///
    /// For convenience, each reference point as well as all results implement the
    /// nsIXULTemplateResult interface, allowing the result objects from each
    /// iteration to be used directly as the reference points for the next
    /// iteration.
    ///
    /// When using multiple queries, each may generate results with the same id.
    /// More than one of these results may match one of the rules in their
    /// respective queries, however only the result for the earliest matching query
    /// in the template becomes the active match and generates output. The
    /// addResult, removeResult, replaceResult and resultBindingChanged methods may
    /// be called by the query processor to indicate that the set of valid results
    /// has changed, such that a different query may match. If a different match
    /// would become active, the content for the existing match is removed and the
    /// content for the new match is generated. A query processor is not required
    /// to provide any support for updating results after they have been generated.
