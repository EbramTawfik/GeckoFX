	/// <summary>
    /// A query processor takes a template query and generates results for it given
    /// a datasource and a reference point. There is a one-to-one relationship
    /// between a template builder and a query processor. The template builder
    /// creates the query processor, and there is no other means to retrieve it.
    ///
    /// A template query is the contents inside a <query> element within the
    /// template. The actual syntax is opaque to the template builder and defined
    /// by a query processor. The query is expected to consist of either text or
    /// DOM nodes that, when executed by a call to the generateResults method, will
    /// allow the generation of a list of results.
    ///
    /// The template builder will supply two variables, the reference variable and
    /// the member variable to further indicate what part of the datasource is to
    /// be examined in addition to the query itself. The reference is always
    /// a placeholder for the starting point and the member is always a placeholder
    /// for the end points (the results).
    ///
    /// The reference point is important when generating output recursively, as
    /// the query will be the same for each iteration, however, the reference point
    /// will differ.
    ///
    /// For instance, when examining an XML source, an XML query processor might
    /// begin at the node referred by the reference variable and end at a list of
    /// that node's children.
    ///
    /// Some queries may not need the reference variable if the syntax or the form
    /// of the data implies the value. For instance, a datasource that holds a
    /// table that can only produce one set of results.
    ///
    /// The reference variable may be specified in a template by setting the
    /// "container" attribute on the <template> element to the variable to use. The
    /// member variable may be specified in a similar way using the "member"
    /// attribute, or it may be specified in the first <action> body in the
    /// template as the value of a uri attribute on an element. A breadth-first
    /// search of the first action is performed to find this element.
    ///
    /// If unspecified, the default value of the reference variable is ?uri.
    ///
    /// For example, a query might have the following syntax:
    ///
    /// (?id, ?name, ?url) from Bookmarks where parentfolder = ?start
    ///
    /// This query might generate a result for each bookmark within a given folder.
    /// The variable ?start would be the reference variable, while the variable ?id
    /// would be the member variable, since it is the unique value that identifies
    /// a result. Each result will have the four variables referred to defined for
    /// it and the values may be retrieved using the result's getBindingFor and
    /// getBindingObjectFor methods.
    ///
    /// The template builder must call initializeForBuilding before the other
    /// methods, except for translateRef. The builder will then call compileQuery
    /// for each query in the template to compile the queries. When results need
    /// to be generated, the builder will call generateResults. The
    /// initializeForBuilding, compileQuery and addBinding methods may not be
    /// called after generateResults has been called until the builder indicates
    /// that the generated output is being removed by calling the done method.
    ///
    /// Currently, the datasource supplied to the methods will always be an
    /// nsIRDFDataSource or a DOM node, and will always be the same one in between
    /// calls to initializeForBuilding and done.
