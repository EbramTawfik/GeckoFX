    /// instance.  The input stream pump will asynchronously read from an input
    /// stream, and push data to an nsIStreamListener instance.  It utilizes the
    /// current thread's nsIEventTarget in order to make reading from the stream
    /// asynchronous. A different thread can be used if the pump also implements
    /// nsIThreadRetargetableRequest.
    ///
    /// If the given stream supports nsIAsyncInputStream, then the stream pump will
    /// call the stream's AsyncWait method to drive the stream listener.  Otherwise,
    /// the stream will be read on a background thread utilizing the stream
    /// transport service.  More details are provided below.
