    /// list (e.g. by calling methods on nsICookieService and friends) is
    /// allowed, but beware that there may be pending notifications you haven't
    /// seen yet -- for instance, a "batch-deleted" notification will likely be
    /// immediately followed by "added". You may check the state of the cookie
    /// list to determine if this is the case.
