    /// This interface provides a mechanism to control an output stream
    /// that takes care not to overwrite an existing target until it is known
    /// that all writes to the destination succeeded.
    ///
    /// An object that supports this interface is intended to also support
    /// nsIOutputStream.
    ///
    /// For example, a file output stream that supports this interface writes to
    /// a temporary file, and moves it over the original file when |finish| is
    /// called only if the stream can be successfully closed and all writes
    /// succeeded.  If |finish| is called but something went wrong during
    /// writing, it will delete the temporary file and not touch the original.
    /// If the stream is closed by calling |close| directly, or the stream
    /// goes away, the original file will not be overwritten, and the temporary
    /// file will be deleted.
    ///
    /// Currently, this interface is implemented only for file output streams.
